This project was developed with ASP.Net Core during Murat Yücedağ's YouTube Project Camp consisting of 150 lessons. It is built with ASP.Net Core 6 MVC. During development, technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, JS, and Bootstrap were used. Database operations were performed using Entity Framework. Plugins used in the project include DataTables, Google Chart, Sweet Alert, and Fluent Validation. The project is supported by APIs, built with Entity Framework Code First, and uses MsSQL as the database. This N-Tier Architecture-based ASP.Net MVC project adheres to SOLID principles wherever possible. A comprehensive blog site was developed with User, Author, and Admin panels.
